# Caching

Caching is a technique used to store **temporary** information in a **high-speed data storage system**. Its primary goals are to **increase the performance** of applications and **decrease the load** on backend services or databases.

## How Caching Works

The fundamental idea is to store frequently accessed data closer to the consumer (the user or application) to avoid repeated, costly trips to the original data source.

*   **Temporary Storage:** The cache is designed for temporary data storage. The data may expire or be invalidated over time.
*   **High-Speed Access:** Caches use faster storage mediums compared to primary data stores.

**Example (Web Browser):** When you visit a website, your browser might cache certain assets (like images, CSS files) locally. The next time you visit the same page, the browser retrieves these assets from its local cache instead of downloading them again from the web server. This makes the page load faster and reduces the load on the server.

## Redis Cache

Caching is also extensively used in the backend of applications to improve performance and reduce the load on databases or APIs. The most popular database system used for backend caching is **Redis Cache**.

### Redis vs. Traditional Databases

The key difference between Redis and traditional databases (like SQL databases) is the storage location:

*   **Redis Cache:** Stores data primarily **in memory (RAM)**.
*   **Traditional Databases:** Store data primarily on **disk**.

Retrieving data from RAM is significantly faster than retrieving it from the disk. This aligns perfectly with the caching definition of being a "high-speed data storage system." Because RAM is typically more expensive and volatile than disk storage, the data stored there is considered "temporary," reinforcing the nature of a cache.

### Cache-Aside Pattern

A common pattern for using a backend cache like Redis is the **Cache-Aside** pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Application
    participant Redis Cache
    participant Backend Database

    Client->>Application: 1. Request Data
    activate Application # Application activated here

    Application->>Redis Cache: 2. Check for Data

    alt 3. Data Found (Cache Hit)
        Redis Cache-->>Application: Data Found (Cache Hit)
        Application-->>Client: 3. Return Data (from Cache)
    # Don't deactivate Application inside this branch
    else 4. Data Not Found (Cache Miss)
        Redis Cache-->>Application: Data Not Found (Cache Miss)
        Application->>Backend Database: 4. Retrieve Data
        activate Backend Database
        Backend Database-->>Application: 4. Return Data (from DB)
        deactivate Backend Database
        Application->>Redis Cache: 5. Store Data (Cache-Aside)
    # Don't deactivate Application inside this branch
        Application-->>Client: 6. Return Data (from DB)
    end

    deactivate Application # Deactivate Application AFTER the alt/else block concludes

    Note over Application, Client: 7. Subsequent requests may hit cache
```

1.  A client makes a request to the web server/application.
2.  The application checks if the requested data is present in the **Redis Cache**.
3.  If the data is found in the cache (**Cache Hit**), the application retrieves it directly from Redis and returns it to the client. This is rapid.
4.  If the data is **not** found in the cache (**Cache Miss**), the application then retrieves the data from the primary **backend database** or external API.
5.  After retrieving the data from the backend, the application **stores a copy of that data in the Redis Cache** (optionally setting an expiration time).
6.  Finally, the application returns the data (now sourced from the backend database) to the client.
7.  Later requests for the same data will now result in a Cache Hit, retrieving the data rapidly from Redis.

### Redis Data Structure

Redis is primarily a **key-value store**. Data is stored as a collection of keys, each associated with a value. Unlike document databases (like Cosmos DB's document API) or relational databases (SQL), it does not store data in structured formats like JSON documents or tables with enforced schemas.

## Benefits

Implementing caching with a service like Azure Cache for Redis offers:

*   **Reduced Latency:** Faster data retrieval due to in-memory storage.
*   **Increased Throughput:** The backend database/API is hit less often, allowing it to handle more requests overall.
*   **Reduced Database/API Load:** Protects backend services from being overwhelmed by repeated requests for the same data.
*   **Cost Savings:** Can potentially reduce costs on your primary database or API services if you pay based on requests or compute usage, as cache hits are less expensive.

Azure Cache for Redis provides a managed instance of the popular open-source Redis, making it easy to leverage these caching benefits in your Azure applications.
