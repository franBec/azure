# Azure API Management Developer Portal

The **Developer Portal** in Azure API Management is a separate website automatically generated for your APIM instance. It serves as the primary interface for **API consumers (developers, partners, internal users)** to discover, learn about, and interact with your published APIs.

## Purpose and Audience

The Developer Portal is designed for external users (often referred to as "Guests" or "Developers" in the context of API Management roles) who need to access and integrate with your APIs. Through the portal, they can:

*   **Explore APIs:** Browse the APIs and Products you have published.
*   **View Documentation:** Access interactive documentation for API operations.
*   **Sign Up and Manage Subscriptions:** Register for an account and subscribe to Products to get **Subscription Keys** required to call the APIs.
*   **Test APIs:** Use the built-in testing console to make calls to API operations directly from the portal (requires a valid subscription key).

## Customization

While a basic developer portal is generated by default, you can fully **customize** its look, feel, and content.

*   API Management provides a visual **designer blade** within the Azure portal specifically for customizing the Developer Portal.
*   You can modify pages like the sign-up page, API exploration pages, add custom content, change branding, etc.

## Publishing Changes

After making customizations in the designer, you must **publish** those changes from the Azure portal for them to become live and visible to external users accessing the Developer Portal URL.

Once published, the Developer Portal becomes a static website accessible via a dedicated URL (different from your APIM gateway endpoint). Users access this public URL to interact with your API documentation and manage their subscriptions.

Providing a user-friendly developer portal is a standard feature expected of API Gateway solutions, and Azure API Management includes this capability out-of-the-box, allowing you to provide a comprehensive experience for your API consumers.
